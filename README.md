# Technical Details

# Credits
I created this project while following a SwiftUI [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwvDm4Vfkdpha5eVTjLM0eRlJ7-yDDwBk) on YouTube by [SwiftfulThinking](https://www.youtube.com/@SwiftfulThinking]SwiftfulThinking) so it is almost the same as the app on the channel besides a few modificaitons made by me. The MVVM architecture style used to organize this app's code was also introduced in the course.
