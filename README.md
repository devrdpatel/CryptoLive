# Crypto Live
All the information a crypto currency enthusiast could need, packed into one SwiftUI application. Credit goes to [SwiftfulThinking](https://www.youtube.com/@SwiftfulThinking]SwiftfulThinking) (see **Credits** section for more details).

# CryptoLive's Purpose
Users can view crypto currency updates live in the app for most popular coins, rather than having to check a coin's price online or having to create a crypto brokerage account. The app also allows users to simulate holdings of a coin at free will to see how their portfolio would perform over a period of time. In addition to crytpo market data, the app also provides additional information about each coin including a 7 day price chart.

# Technical Details
- All crypto market and currency data is fetched asynchronously using [CoinGecko's API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) (Free version limits API calls per min)
- 

# Upcoming features
I am currently working on the following features:
- Giving users the options to view price charts for different time periods
- 

# Credits
I created this project while following a SwiftUI [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwvDm4Vfkdpha5eVTjLM0eRlJ7-yDDwBk) on YouTube by [SwiftfulThinking](https://www.youtube.com/@SwiftfulThinking]SwiftfulThinking) so it is almost the same as the app on the channel besides a few modificaitons made by me. The MVVM architecture style used to organize this app's code was also introduced in the course.
